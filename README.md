## Inspiration  
With the number of events happening around campus, itâ€™s hard to keep track of everything. We built BisionsConnect to assist students in discovering and managing events effortlessly.

## How We Built It  
We developed the project using **Next.js** and **ShadCN** to handle most of the heavy lifting. For database management, we used **Drizzle ORM** to ensure a smooth and efficient data flow.

## Challenges We Ran Into  
One of the main challenges we faced was our initial technology choice. We realized that it wasn't the best fit for our needs, so we switched to **Next.js**, which allowed us to rapidly prototype and iterate on our solution.

## Accomplishments We're Proud Of  
We're proud of creating a **working MVP** in a short amount of time, enabling quick iterations without getting stuck on complex ideas.

## What We Learned  
We gained valuable insights into modern web development and the power of tools like **Next.js** and **ShadCN**. These libraries made building user interfaces faster and more efficient. Additionally, Next.js helped us manage the **multi-page** nature of an events application.

## What's Next for BisionsConnect  
We plan to enhance BisionsConnect by:  
- Improving the **event management system**  
- Integrating **real-time communication** tools  
- Expanding features for **better user interaction and scalability**  
- Optimizing **performance and user experience** based on feedback
